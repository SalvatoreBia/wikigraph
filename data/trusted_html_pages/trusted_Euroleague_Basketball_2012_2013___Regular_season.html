<h1>Euroleague Basketball 2012-2013 - Regular Season: A Comprehensive Review</h1>

<p>The 2012-2013 Euroleague Basketball regular season, spanning from October 12th to December 14th, 2012, laid the foundation for a fiercely competitive tournament.  This phase determined the sixteen teams that would advance to the prestigious Top 16.  The season was structured into three groups – A, B, and C – each comprised of six teams.  The top four teams from each group secured their place in the next stage of the competition.</p>

<h2>Regular Season Format and Tie-Breaking Rules</h2>

<p>The regular season followed a double round-robin format, meaning each team played every other team in its group twice – once at home and once away.  A win earned a team two points, while a loss awarded zero.  In the event of a tie in the standings, a complex set of tie-breaking rules were implemented to determine the higher-ranked team. These rules, applied sequentially, were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Head-to-head record (wins and losses) between the tied teams.</li>
  <li>Point difference in the head-to-head games.</li>
  <li>Overall point difference across all regular season games.</li>
  <li>Total points scored in the regular season.</li>
  <li>Sum of quotients of points scored and points conceded in each game of the regular season.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Group A: Real Madrid Dominates</h2>

<p>Group A witnessed a commanding performance from Real Madrid, who finished atop the standings with a 10-4 record. Their impressive +94 point difference underscored their dominance.  Chimki Moscow followed in second place (10-4), closely trailed by Panathinaikos Athens (10-4).  Fenerbahçe Ülker Istanbul secured the final Top 16 berth from this group with a 5-9 record.</p>
